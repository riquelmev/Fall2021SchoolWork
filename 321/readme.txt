For depth 16, using the num wrong tiles heuristic, the Time Taken was: 0.8136961460113525

For depth 16, using the Manhattan distance tiles heuristic, the Time Taken was: 0.002485990524291992

For all the loops using the num wrong tiles heuristic, the Time Taken was: 0.9850122928619385
	

For all the loops using the Manhattan distance tiles heuristic, the Time Taken was: 0.04260897636413574

Thus, we can conclude that the Manhattan distance tiles heuristic is a much better heuristic than the num wrong tiles.


Also, compared to the iterative deepening speed of 240 seconds for the depth of 16 and 600 total, this was a much faster/better algorithm.
